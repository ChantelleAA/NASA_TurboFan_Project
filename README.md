The problem of this project is:

Forecast	when	the	engine	is	due	to	maintenance
Predict	the	remaining	useful	life	of	test	partition	observations,	based	on	the	models	
calibrated	with	the	training	data.	You	know	that	in	the	training	partition,	the	engine	runs	
until	 failure.	 That	 means,	 the	 maximum	 operating	 cycle	 for	 a	 unit	 +1	 was	 the	 failure	
operation.	Make	four	prediction	models	and predict	the	remaining	useful	life	for	the	test	
partition,	using	the	model	calibrated	with	the	training	data	partition.
Note:	You	need	all	four	operational	settings	datasets,	both	training	and	testing	partitions	
for	this	task.

Partial Least Squares regression is first used to attempt this problem
